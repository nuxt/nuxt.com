**Zero Configuration âœ¨**
:br
Integration with [Stormkit](https://www.stormkit.io/) is possible with zero configuration.
::

## Setup

Follow the steps to [create a new app](https://app.stormkit.io/apps/new) on Stormkit.

## Deployment

By default, Stormkit will deploy your apps automatically when you push changes to your main branch. But to trigger a manual deploy (for example, you might do this for the very first deployment), you may click `Deploy now`.
