**Zero Config Provider**
:br
Integration with this provider is possible with zero configuration. ([Learn More](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/#zero-config-providers))
::

## Deploy using Git

1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
2. [Import your project](https://vercel.com/new) into Vercel.
3. Vercel will detect that you are using Nitro and will enable the correct settings for your deployment.
4. Your application is deployed!

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate [Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#preview), and all changes made to the Production Branch (commonly “main”) will result in a [Production Deployment](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/environments#production).

Learn more about Vercel’s [Git Integration](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## Vercel Edge Functions

**Preset:** `vercel_edge` ([switch to this preset](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/#changing-the-deployment-preset))

It is possible to deploy your nitro applications directly on [Vercel Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions).

- Vercel Edge Functions allow you to deliver content to your site's visitors with speed and personalization.
- They are deployed globally by default on Vercel's Edge Network and enable you to move server-side logic to the Edge, close to your visitor's origin.
- Edge Functions use the Vercel Edge Runtime, which is built on the same high-performance V8 JavaScript and WebAssembly engine that is used by the Chrome browser.
- By taking advantage of this small runtime, Edge Functions can have faster cold boots and higher scalability than Serverless Functions.
- Edge Functions run after the cache, and can both cache and return responses. [Read More](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions)

In order to enable this target, please set `NITRO_PRESET` environment variable to `vercel_edge`.

## Vercel KV Storage

You can easily use [Vercel KV Storage](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) with [Nitro Storage](https://nitro.unjs.io//guide/storage).

::callout{type="warning"}
This feature is currently in beta. Please check [driver docs](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/vercel-kv).
::

1. Install `@vercel/kv` dependency:

```json [package.json]
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@vercel/kv": "latest"
  }
}
```

Update your configuration:

::code-group
```ts [nitro.config.ts]
export default defineNitroConfig({
  storage: {
    data: { driver: 'vercelKV' }
  }
})
```
```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    storage: {
      data: { driver: 'vercelKV' }
    }
  }
})
```
::

::callout
You need to either set `KV_REST_API_URL` and `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` environment variables or pass `url` and `token` to driver options. Check [driver docs](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/vercel-kv) for more information about usage.
::

You can now access data store in any event handler:

```ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const dataStorage = useStorage("data");
  await dataStorage.setItem("hello", "world");
  return {
    hello: await dataStorage.getItem("hello"),
  };
});
```

## API routes

Nitro `/api` directory isn't compatible with Vercel.
Instead, you have to use :

- `routes/api/` for standalone usage
- `server/api/` with [Nuxt].

## Custom Build Output Configuration

You can provide additional [build output configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) using `vercel.config` key inside `nitro.config`. It will be merged with built-in auto generated config.

## On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

On-demand revalidation allows you to purge the cache for an ISR route whenever you want, foregoing the time interval required with background revalidation.

To revalidate a page on demand:

1. Create an Environment Variable which will store a revalidation secret
    * You can use the command `openssl rand -base64 32` or https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32 to generate a random value.

2. Update your configuration:

    ::code-group
    ```ts [nitro.config.ts]
    export default defineNitroConfig({
      vercel: {
        config: {
          bypassToken: process.env.VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN
        }
      }
    })
    ```
    ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
    export default defineNuxtConfig({
      nitro: {
        vercel: {
          config: {
            bypassToken: process.env.VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN
          }
        }
      }
    })
    ```
    ::

3. To trigger "On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)" and revalidate a path to a Prerender Function, make a GET or HEAD request to that path with a header of x-prerender-revalidate: `<bypassToken>`. When that Prerender Function endpoint is accessed with this header set, the cache will be revalidated. The next request to that function should return a fresh response.
