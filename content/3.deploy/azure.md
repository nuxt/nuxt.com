## Azure Static Web Apps

::tip
**Zero Configuration âœ¨**
:br
Integration with Azure Static Web Apps provider is possible with zero configuration, [learn more](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy#zero-config-providers).
::

Azure Static Web Apps are designed to be deployed continuously in a [GitHub Actions workflow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/github-actions-workflow). By default, Nuxt will detect this deployment environment to enable the `azure` preset.

### Local preview

Install [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local) if you want to test locally.

You can invoke a development environment to preview before deploying.

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxi build --preset=azure
npx @azure/static-web-apps-cli start .output/public --api-location .output/server
```

### Configuration

Azure Static Web Apps are [configured](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration) using the `staticwebapp.config.json` file.

Nuxt automatically generates this configuration file whenever the application is built with the `azure` preset.

It adds the following properties based on the following criteria:

| Property | Criteria | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **[platform.apiRuntime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#platform)** | Will automatically set to `node:16` or `node:14` depending on your package configuration. | `node:16` |
| **[navigationFallback.rewrite](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#fallback-routes)** | Is always `/api/server` | `/api/server` |
| **[routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/configuration#routes)** | All prerendered routes are added. Additionally, if you do not have an `index.html` file an empty one is created for you for compatibility purposes and also requests to `/index.html` are redirected to the root directory which is handled by `/api/server`.  | `[]` |

### Custom Configuration

You can alter the generated configuration using `azure.config` option. For instance, if you wanted to specify a Node runtime for your Azure Functions, edit your `nuxt.config.ts` file to the following:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  // ...
  nitro: {
    azure: {
      config: {
        // ...
        platform: {
          apiRuntime: 'node:18'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Custom routes will be added and matched first. In the case of a conflict (determined if an object has the same route property), custom routes will override generated ones.

### Deploy from CI/CD via GitHub Actions

When you link your GitHub repository to Azure Static Web Apps, a workflow file is added to the repository.

When you are asked to select your framework, select custom and provide the following information:

| Input | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **app_location** | '/' |
| **api_location** | '.output/server' |
| **output_location** | '.output/public' |

If you miss this step, you can always find the build configuration section in your workflow and update the build configuration:

```yaml [.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-<RANDOM_NAME>.yml]
###### Repository/Build Configurations ######
app_location: '/'
api_location: '.output/server'
output_location: '.output/public'
###### End of Repository/Build Configurations ######
```

::alert
That's it! Now Azure Static Web Apps will automatically deploy your Nitro-powered application on push.
::

If you are using `runtimeConfig`, you will likely want to configure the corresponding [environment variables on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/application-settings).
