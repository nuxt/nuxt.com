## Cloudflare Pages

::tip
**Zero Configuration âœ¨**
:br
Integration with Cloudflare Pages is possible with zero configuration, [learn more](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy#zero-config-providers).
::

::important
Checkout the [@nuxthub/core](/modules/hub) module to build full-stack Nuxt applications with Cloudflare, learn more on [hub.nuxt.com](https://hub.nuxt.com).
::

### Git Integration

If you use the GitHub/GitLab integration with Cloudflare Pages, **no configuration is required**. Pushing to your repository will automatically build your project and deploy it.

::note
Nuxt will detect the environment to set the correct [Server/Nitro preset](https://nitro.unjs.io/deploy/providers/cloudflare).
::

To leverage server-side rendering on the edge, set the build command to: `nuxt build`

To statically generate your website, set the build command to: `nuxt generate`

### Route matching

On CloudFlare Pages, if an HTML file is found with a matching path to the current route requested, it will serve it. It will also redirect HTML pages to their extension-less counterparts: for instance, `/contact.html` will be redirected to `/contact`, and `/about/index.html` will be redirected to `/about/`.

To match Cloudflare [route matching](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/serving-pages/#route-matching) rules, set the nitro option `autoSubfolderIndex` to `false`.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    prerender: {
      autoSubfolderIndex: false
    }
  }
})
```

### Direct Upload

Alternatively, you can use [wrangler](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk) to upload your project to Cloudflare.

In this case, you will have to set the preset manually.

1. Build your project for Cloudflare Pages:

    ```bash [Terminal]
    npx nuxi build --preset=cloudflare_pages
    ```

2. Deploy, it will ask you to create a project for the first time:

    ```bash [Terminal]
    wrangler pages deploy dist/
    ```

## Disable Auto Minify

Make sure to disable the minification of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in **CloudFlare -> Speed -> Optimization -> Auto Minify** to avoid any Vue hydration.
