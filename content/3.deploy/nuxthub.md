## Introduction

NuxtHub is a deployment and administration platform for Nuxt, powered by Cloudflare.

The main difference with the [Cloudflare](/deploy/cloudflare) deployment is that NuxtHub provides a zero-configuration deployment experience (provisioning, deployment, and administration).

It also provides a powerful admin interface to manage your Nuxt projects (database, blob, KV, ...) as well as [remote storage](https://hub.nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/remote-storage?utm_source=nuxt-website&utm_medium=deploy-page).

Read more on [hub.nuxt.com](https://hub.nuxt.com/?utm_source=nuxt-website&utm_medium=deploy-page).

## NuxtHub CLI

You can deploy your local project with a single command:

```bash [Terminal]
npx nuxthub deploy
```

The command will:
1. Ensure you are logged in on [admin.hub.nuxt.com](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/?utm_source=nuxt-website&utm_medium=deploy-page)
2. Link your local project with a NuxtHub project or help you create a new one
3. Build your Nuxt project with the correct preset
4. Deploy it to your Cloudflare account with all the necessary resources
4. Provide you with a URL to access your project

See an example in video:

  :source{src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1723569534/nuxthub/nuxthub-deploy_xxs5s8.webm" type="video/webm"}
  :source{src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1723569534/nuxthub/nuxthub-deploy_xxs5s8.mp4" type="video/mp4"}
  :source{src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1723569534/nuxthub/nuxthub-deploy_xxs5s8.ogg" type="video/ogg"}

::note
You can also install the [NuxtHub CLI](https://github.com/nuxt-hub/cli) globally with: `npm i -g nuxthub`.
::

::warning
If you do your first deployment with the NuxtHub CLI, you won't be able to attach your GitHub/GitLab repository later on due to a Cloudflare limitation.
::

## Deploy using Git

1. Push your code to your git repository (GitHub or GitLab)
2. Click on `New Project` then `Import a Git repository`
3. Select your repository and click on `Import repository`
4. NuxtHub will configure your project on Cloudflare Pages and deploy it
5. Your application is deployed with a `.nuxt.dev` domain

After your project has been imported and deployed, all subsequent pushes to branches will generate preview deployments and all changes made to the production branch (commonly “main”) will result in a production deployment.
