## ‚ö°Ô∏è Vue 3.3 released

Vue 3.3 has been released, with lots of exciting features, particularly around type support.

This also brings a significant improvement to data fetching when navigating between nested pages ([#20777](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20777)), thanks to [@antfu](https://github.com/antfu) and [@baiwusanyu-c](https://github.com/baiwusanyu-c).

Read **[full release announcement](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-3-3)**.

## üíñ New defaults

**Rich JSON payload serialisation** is now enabled by default ([#19205](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/19205) and [#20770](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20770)).

This is both faster and allows serialising complex objects in the payload passed from the Nuxt server to client (and also when extracting payload data for prerendered sites).

## üõù Interactive server components

This feature should be considered highly experimental, but thanks to some great work from [@huang-julien](https://github.com/huang-julien) we now support interactive content within server components via _slots_ ([#20284](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20284)).

## ‚è∞ Environment config

You can now config fully typed, per-environment overrides in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  $production: {
    routeRules: {
      '/**': { isr: true }
    }
  },
  $development: {
    // Overwrites in development
  },
  // Config for all environments
})
```

## üí™ Fully typed pages

You can benefit from fully typed routing within your Nuxt app via this experimental integration with [unplugin-vue-router](https://github.com/posva/unplugin-vue-router) - thanks to some great work from [@posva](https://github.com/posva)!

Out of the box, this will enable typed usage of [`navigateTo`](/docs/api/utils/navigate-to), [`<NuxtLink>`](/docs/api/components/nuxt-link), `router.push()` and more.

You can even get typed params within a page by using `const route = useRoute('route-name')`{lang=ts}.

Enable this feature directly in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  experimental: {
    typedPages: true
  }
})
```

## üîé 'Bundler' module resolution

We now have full support within Nuxt for the `bundler` strategy of [module resolution](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html).

We would recommend adopting this if possible. It has type support for subpath exports, for example, but more exactly matches the behaviour of build tools like Vite and Nuxt than `Node16` resolution.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  typescript: {
    tsConfig: {
      compilerOptions: {
        moduleResolution: 'bundler'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## ‚öóÔ∏è Separate server types

We plan to improve clarity within your IDE between the 'nitro' and 'vue' part of your app, we've shipped the first part of this via a separate generated `tsconfig.json` for your [`~/server`](/docs/guide/directory-structure/server) directory ([#20559](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/20559)).

You can use by adding an additional `~/server/tsconfig.json` with the following content:

```json
{
  "extends": "../.nuxt/tsconfig.server.json"
}
```

Although right now these values won't be respected when type checking (`nuxi typecheck`), you should get better type hints in your IDE.

## üíÄ Deprecations

Although we have not typed or documented the `build.extend` hook from Nuxt 2, we have been calling it within the webpack builder. We are now explicitly deprecating this and will remove it in a future minor version.

## ‚úÖ Upgrading

As usual, our recommendation for upgrading is to run:

```sh
nuxi upgrade --force
```

This will refresh your lockfile as well, and ensures that you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.
