We are thrilled to announce the release of [Nuxt DevTools v1.0](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools)! ðŸŽ‰

Since this release, Nuxt DevTools is now enabled with [Nuxt v3.8](/blog/v3-8) and onwards by default. Generally available to all Nuxt projects!

You can start playing with it by upgrading to the latest Nuxt, and press `Shift + Option + D` (macOS) or `Shift + Alt + D` (Windows) in your browser to open the DevTools. By default the floating panel is hidden to reduce the distraction. You can enable it inside Nuxt DevTools settings page, or explicitly enabled it in your config:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: {
    enabled: true
  }
})
```

## The Reasons We Build Nuxt DevTools

Over the recent years, there has been an increasing focus on Developer Experience (DX). Tools and frameworks have been striving to improve the DX. Along the way, Nuxt introduced many innovative features and conventions to make your day-to-day development easier and more efficient.

For example, [file-based routing](/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages), [layout system](/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts), [plugins](/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins), [route middleware](/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware), [composables auto-import](/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports), [file-based server APIs](https://nitro.unjs.io/guide/introduction/routing), [powerful module system](/modules) and many more.

Nuxt is capable of creating various range of applications, from simple hobby projects to large scale applications, from simple client-rendered single-page applications to hybrid rendered sites with serverless functions on edge, etc. We provide those features and conventions to make it easier to support all those use cases and scenarios.

### The Problem

Out of all these benefits of having a powerful framework, we have to made some trade-offs. Sometimes, we have to sacrifice a bit of the transparency of the underlying implementation to make things easier to use.

!["Transparency" as the trade offs of having "Conventions", "Abstractions", "Sensible Defaults" and "Normalizations"](/assets/blog/devtools/slide-transparency.png){.border.border-gray-200.dark:border-gray-700.rounded-lg}

Conventions abstractions are great things to transfer implementation complexity and make things easier to get more focus when building. On the other hand, they can also add extra burden for users to learn and understand what's going on under the hood. Leading also to implicitness, like where a auto-imported component is from, or how many modules is using a certain component, etc. It can also make things hard to debug.

Trade-offs are inevitable. Generally we believe those trade-offs are worth it, as they would help organizing users' codebase and make it easier to maintain in the long run. In the meantime, we also want to compensate the transparency we lost by providing a tool to help you understand what's going on under the hood and make the learning curve smoother.

That's where Nuxt DevTools comes in! We [first introduced it](/blog/introducing-nuxt-devtools) in February 2023 to experiment with the idea. After a few months of exploration and development, from surprisingly positive feedbacks from the community, this idea has been proven to be useful and we decided to make it a core part of your Nuxt development experience.

## Features

[Nuxt DevTools](https://github.com/nuxt/devtools) is a set of visual tools to help you understand your Nuxt app and improve the developer experience even further. It's created to provide a better transparency of Nuxt and your app, find performance bottlenecks and help you manage your app and configuration.

### In App DevTools

From the overview, Nuxt DevTools is an in-app DevTools that lives alongside your app. It will show up as a floating panel that you can click to open.

We believe this is a better approach than the traditional browser extension DevTools, as it's:

- **Works across all browsers**, and even on mobile devices! - The capability of browser extension DevTools are limited by the APIs each browsers provides, and also maintain multiple extensions would require a lot of efforts. This approach would allow us to focus more on the functionality and features, while having it accessible users on any browsers and devices.
- **Build tools integrations** - Tranditionally browser extension DevTools are only able to access the runtime context of your app and have no access to the build tools. Having the DevTools comes with Nuxt, allows us to communicate with the build tools and provide much more insights and features.
- **Avoid layout shfits** - Having the DevTools as a floating panel would avoid the layout shifts when toggling the DevTools.

### Pages View

To help improving the implicitness of the file-based routing, we introduced the Pages View in DevTools. It lists all the pages that been registered in your app, that you can easily test and navigate between them.

### Components View

The Components tab show all the components you are using in your app and where they are from. You can also search for them and go to the source code.

It also provides a graph view that show the relationship between components. You can filter the components to see the dependencies of a specific component. This could help to identify unintended dependencies and improve the performance and bundle size of pages.

### Modules Management

The Modules tab shows all the modules that are registered in your app, with the links to thier documentations and repositories.

We also provides the ability for you to search and explore the modules from the community. And install them with a single click!

### Static Assets Management

The Assets tab shows all the static assets under your `public` directory. It supports previewing images, videos, fonts, PDFs, and other files, that you can easily copy the URL or code snippet to use in your app. You may also drag and drop files to upload them directly from Nuxt DevTools.

### Runtime Configs Editor

### Component Inspector

The Inspector allows you to inspect the DOM tree and see which component is rendering it. Click to go to your editor of the specific line. Making it much easier to make changes, without the requirement of understanding the project structure thoroughly.
