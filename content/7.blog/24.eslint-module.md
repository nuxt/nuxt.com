[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) has become en essential tool for today's web development. It helps you to catch errors and enforce consistent coding style in your project. In Nuxt, we try to provide the out-of-the-box experience for ESLint, making it easy to use and configure and following the best practices we recommend. 

Over time, both Nuxt and ESLint has evolved a lot since then. And historically, we ended up with [a few different packages and integrations for ESLint in Nuxt](https://eslint.nuxt.com/guide/faq#package-disambiguation), and wasn't always very clear which one to use. Recently, we have refreshed our ESLint integrations to support ESLint v9 with the flat config and opens up many more capabilities for customizing your ESLint setup, providing a more straightforward and unified experience.

## Nuxt ESLint Monorepo

To solve the confusion and provide a more unified experience, we move ESLint related packages which were previously scattered across different repositories into a single monorepo: [`nuxt/eslint`](https://nuxt.com/modules/eslint), with a dedicated new documentation site: [eslint.nuxt.com](https://eslint.nuxt.com/).

To help understanding the differences between each package and what to use, we also have a [FAQ](https://eslint.nuxt.com/guide/faq) page comparing them and explaining the their scopes.

This monorepo now includes:

- `@nuxt/eslint` - The new, all-in-one ESLint module for Nuxt 3, supporting project-aware ESLint flat config and more.
- `@nuxt/eslint-config` - The unopinionated but customizable shared ESLint config for Nuxt 3. Supports both [the flat config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files) and [the legacy format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-deprecated).
- `@nuxt/eslint-plugin` - The ESLint plugin for Nuxt 3, providing Nuxt-specific rules and configurations.
- And a few legacy packages for Nuxt 2 in maintenance mode.

## ESLint Flat Config

Before we start to talk about the new Nuxt integrations, let me first introduce you a bit about the concept of [ESLint flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files).

Flat config is the new default configuration format introduced that first landed as experimental in ESLint v8.21.0, and became stable and the default in [ESLint v9](https://eslint.org/blog/2024/04/eslint-v9.0.0-released/).

A quick reference to differentiate:

- **Flat config**: `eslint.config.js` `eslint.config.mjs` etc.
- **Legacy config**: `.eslintrc` `.eslintrc.json` `.eslintrc.js` etc.

### Why Flat Config?

[This blog post from ESLint](https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-1/) explains the motivation behind the flat config system in detail. In short, the legacy eslintrc format was designed at the early time of JavaScript, where ES modules and modern JavaScript features were not yet standardized. There were many implicit conventions evolved, and the `extends` feature makes the final config result hard to understand and predict. Which also make shared configs hard to maintain and debug.

```jsonc [.eslintrc]
{
  "extends": [
    // Solve from `import("@nuxtjs/eslint-config").then(mod => mod.default)`
    "@nuxtjs",
    // Solve from `import("eslint-config-vue").then(mod => mod.default.configs["vue3-recommended"])`
    "plugin:vue/vue3-recommended",
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
  }
}
```

The new flat config moves the plugins and configs resolution from ESLint's internal convention to the native ES module resolution, which makes it more explicit and transparent, that you can even import it from other modules. Since the flat config is just a JavaScript module, it also opens the door for much more customization and possibilities.

## Nuxt Presets for Flat Config

In the latest [`@nuxt/eslint-config` package](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/config#flat-config-format), we leverage the flexibility we have to provide a factory function that allows you customize the config presets easily in a more high-level way. Here is an example of how you can use it:

```ts [eslint.config.js]
import nuxt from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'

export default nuxt()
```

`@nuxt/eslint-config` starts with an unopinionated base config, which means we only include rules for best practices of TypeScript, Vue and Nuxt, and leave the rest like code style, formatting, etc for you to decide. You can also run [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) alongside for formatting with the defaults.

The config also allows to opt-in more opinionated features as need. For example, if you want ESLint to take care of the formatting as well, you can turn it on by passing `features.stylistic` to the factory function (powered by [ESLint Stylistic](https://eslint.style/)):

```ts [eslint.config.js]
import nuxt from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'

export default nuxt({
  features: {
    stylistic: true
  }
})
```

Or tweak the your preferences with an options object ([learn more with the options here](https://eslint.style/guide/config-presets#configuration-factory)):

```ts [eslint.config.js]
import nuxt from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'

export default nuxt({
  features: {
    stylistic: {
      semi: false,
      indent: 2, // 4 or 'tab'
      quotes: 'single',
      // ... and more
    }
  }
})
```

And if you are [authoring a Nuxt Module](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/modules), you can turn on `features.tooling` to enable the rules for the Nuxt module development:

```ts [eslint.config.js]
import nuxt from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'

export default nuxt({
  features: {
    tooling: true
  }
})
```

...and so on. The factory function in flat config allows the presets to cover the complexity for underlying ESLint configuration, and provide high-level and user-friendly abstractions for end users to customize. Without requiring users to worry about the internal details.

While this approach offers you a Prettier-like experience with minimal configurations, because it's powered by ESLint, you still get the full flexibility to customize and overrides fine-grained rules and plugins as needed. 

We also made a [`FlatConfigComposer`](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-flat-config-utils#composer) utility from [`eslint-flat-config-utils`](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-flat-config-utils) to make it even easier to override and extends the flat config. The factory function in `@nuxt/eslint-config/flat` returns a `FlatConfigComposer` instance already:

```ts [eslint.config.js]
import nuxt from '@nuxt/eslint-config/flat'

export default nuxt({
  // ...options for Nuxt integration
})
  .append(
    // ...append other flat config items
  )
  .prepend(
    // ...prepend other flat config items before the base config
  )
  // override a specific config item based on their name
  .override(
    'nuxt/typescript', // specify the name of the target config, or index
    {
      rules: {
        // ...override the rules
        '@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-assignment': 'off'
      }
    }
  )
  // an so on, operations are chainable
```

With this approach, we get the best of both worlds: the simplicity and high-level abstraction for easy to use, and the power for customization and fine-tuning.

## Nuxt ESLint Module

Taking this even further, we made the new, all-in-one [`@nuxt/eslint` module](https://eslint.nuxt.com/packages/module) for Nuxt 3. It leverages Nuxt's context to generate project-aware and type-safe ESLint configurations for your project.

### Project-aware Rules

We know that Vue's Style Guide suggests to use [multi-word names for components](https://vuejs.org/style-guide/rules-essential.html#use-multi-word-component-names) to avoid conflicts with existing and future HTML elements. Thus, in [`eslint-plugin-vue`](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue), we have the rule [`vue/multi-word-component-names`](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/multi-word-component-names.html) enabled by default. It's a good practice to follow, but we know that in a Nuxt project, not all `.vue` files are registered as components. Files like `app.vue`, `pages/index.vue`, `layouts/default.vue`, etc. are not available as components in other Vue files, and the rule will irrelevant for them.

Usually, we could disable the rule for those files like:

```js [eslint.config.js]
export default [
  {
    files: ['*.vue'],
    rules: {
      'vue/multi-word-component-names': 'error'
    }
  },
  {
    files: ['app.vue', 'error.vue', 'pages/**/*.vue', 'layouts/**/*.vue'],
    rules: {
      // disable the rule for these files
      'vue/multi-word-component-names': 'off'
    }
  }
]
```

It should works for majority of the cases, however, we know that in Nuxt you can [customize the path for each directory](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#dir), and [layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers) allows you to have multiple sources for each directory. This means the linter rules will be less accurate and potentially cause users extra effort to keep them aligned **manually**.

Similarly we want to have [`vue/no-multiple-template-root`](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/no-multiple-template-root.html) enabled only for `pages` and `layouts` etc. As the cases grows, it becomes unrealistic to ask users to maintain the rules manually.

That's where the magic of `@nuxt/eslint` comes in! It leverage the Nuxt's context to the generates the configurations and rules that specific to your project structure. Very similiar to the [`.nuxt/tsconfig.json`](http://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/typescript#auto-generated-types) Nuxt provides, you now also have the project-aware `.nuxt/eslint.config.mjs` to extend from.

To use it, you can simply add the module to your Nuxt project:

```bash
npx nuxi module add eslint
```
