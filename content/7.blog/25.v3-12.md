## üöÄ Testing Nuxt v4 breaking changes

It's now possible to test out the behaviour changes that will be coming in Nuxt v4 ([#26925](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26925)) by setting an option in your `nuxt.config` file:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  future: {
    compatibilityVersion: 4,
  },
})
```

There is a lot to say here, but for full details, including migration steps, see [the documentation](/docs/getting-started/upgrade#testing-nuxt-4).

## üìú Nuxt Scripts auto-install

We've been gradually working to release Nuxt Scripts. It's currently in public preview, but we're near a public release, so we've added some stubs for composables that (when used) will prompt installing the `@nuxt/scripts` module.

üëâ Watch out for the launch - and an article explaining more!

## üåà Layer auto-registration

Just like `~/modules`, any layers within your project in the `~/layers` directory will now be automatically registered as layers in your project ([#27221](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27221)).

## üåê Built-in accessibility

We now have a built-in [`<NuxtRouteAnnouncer>`](/docs/api/components/nuxt-route-announcer) component and corresponding [`useRouteAnnouncer`](/docs/api/composables/use-route-announcer) composable, which will be added by default to new Nuxt templates going forward.

For full details, see [the original PR (#25741)](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/25741) and [documentation](/docs/api/components/nuxt-route-announcer).

We're continuing to work on `nuxt/a11y` - expect to hear more on that in future!

## üî• Performance improvements

We've landed some performance improvements as well, many of which are behind the `compatibilityVersion: 4` flag.

Significant improvements include deduplicating modules ([#27475](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27475)) - which will apply mostly to layer users who specify modules in their layers.

We've also improved Vite dev server start up time by excluding common ESM dependencies from pre-bundling, and would suggest module authors consider doing the same ([#27372](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27372)).

We also improved chunk determinism, so sequential builds should be less likely to have _completely_ different chunk hashes ([#27258](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27258)).

And we tree shake more client-only composables from your server builds ([#27044](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27044)).

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Multi-app support

We've landed a couple of changes that take us toward a place of supporting multi-app natively in Nuxt, including a `multiApp` experimental flag ([#27291](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27291)) and the ability to have multiple Nuxt app instances running in parallel at runtime ([#27068](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27068)).

## ‚õëÔ∏è DX wins

We now serialise more things in your dev server logs, including VNodes and URLs. We also addressed a bug that could lead to a frozen dev server.

When accessing private runtime config in the browser, we now let you know with a more informative error message ([#26441](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26441)).

## üì¶ Module author/power user improvements

We have shipped a range of type improvements for module authors, including:

- support for typed module options in `installModule` ([#26744](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/26744))
- the option to specify compatibility with certain builders (vite/webpack) in module options ([#27022](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27022))
- a new `onPrehydrate` hook for hooking into the browser hydration cycle ([#27037](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27037))
- the ability to access and update _resolved_ runtime configuration within modules with new build-time `useRuntimeConfig` and `updateRuntimeConfig` utils ([#27117](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27117))
