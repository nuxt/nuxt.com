## 🏘️ Route groups

We now support naming directories with parentheses/brackets in order to organise your routes without an effect on the path.

For example:

```bash [Directory structure]
-| pages/
---| index.vue
---| (marketing)/
-----| about.vue
-----| contact.vue
```

This will produce `/`, `/about` and `/contact` pages in your app. The `marketing` group is ignored for purposes of your URL structure.

Read more in [the original PR](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28276).

## 🏝️ Islands and head metadata

It's now possible for server component islands to manipulate the head, such as by adding SEO metadata when rendering.

Read more in [#27987](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27987).

## 🪝 Custom prefetch triggers

We now support custom prefetch triggers for `NuxtLink` ([#27846](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27846)).

For example:

```vue [pages/index.vue]
<template>
  <div>
    <NuxtLink prefetch-on="interaction">
      This will prefetch when hovered or when it gains focus
    </NuxtLink>
    <!-- note that you probably don't want both enabled! -->
    <NuxtLink :prefetch-on="{ visibility: true, interaction: true }">
      This will prefetch when hovered/focus - or when it becomes visible
    </NuxtLink>
  </div>
</template>
```

It's also possible to enable/disable these globally for your app, and override on a per-link basis.

For example:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  experimental: {
    defaults: {
      nuxtLink: {
        prefetch: true,
        prefetchOn: { visibility: false, interaction: true },
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## 🗺️  Better server sourcemaps

When running with `node --enable-source-maps`, you may have noticed that the source maps for the Vue files in your server build pointed to the Vite build output (something like `.nuxt/dist/server/_nuxt/index-O15BBwZ3.js`).

Now, even after your Nitro build, your server sourcemaps will reference your original source files ([#28521](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28521)).

Note that one of the easiest ways of improving your build performance is to turn off sourcemaps if you aren't using them, which you can do easily in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  sourcemap: {
    server: false,
    client: true,
  },
})
```

## 🎁 New features for module authors

In the run-up to Nuxt v4, we're working on adding some key functionality for module authors, including a new `isNuxtMajorVersion` utility where required ([#27579](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27579)) and better inferred typing for merged module options using the new `defineNuxtModule().with()` method ([#27520](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27520)).

## ✨ Improved dev warnings

We no longer warn when using data fetching composables in middleware ([#28604](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/28604)) and we warn when user components' names begin with Lazy ([#27838](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/27838)).

## 🚨 Vue TypeScript changes

For a while, in the Vue ecosystem we've been augmenting `@vue/runtime-core` to add custom properties and more to `vue`. However, this inadvertently breaks the types for projects that augment `vue` - which is now the officially recommended in the docs way to augment these interfaces (for example, [ComponentCustomProperties](https://vuejs.org/api/utility-types.html#componentcustomproperties), [GlobalComponents](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/web-components.html#web-components-and-typescript) and [so on](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/options-api.html#augmenting-global-properties)).

This means _all_ libraries must update their code (or it will break the types of the libraries that augment `vue` instead).

We've updated our types in Nuxt along these lines but you may experience issues with the latest `vue-router` when used with libraries which haven't yet done so.

Please create an issue with a reproduction - I'll happily help create a PR to resolve in the upstream library in question. Or you may be able to work around the issue by creating a `declarations.d.ts` in the root of your project with the following code ([credit]()):

```ts [declarations.d.ts]
import type {
  ComponentCustomOptions as _ComponentCustomOptions,
  ComponentCustomProperties as _ComponentCustomProperties,
} from 'vue';

declare module '@vue/runtime-core' {
  interface ComponentCustomProperties extends _ComponentCustomProperties {}
  interface ComponentCustomOptions extends _ComponentCustomOptions {}
}
```
