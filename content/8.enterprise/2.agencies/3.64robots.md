64 Robots is a software agency that specializes in custom software development using a powerful tech stack, consisting of Laravel, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, AWS, and Figma. Founded in 2016 and based in Baltimore, Maryland, our primary focus is on building highly-scalable, accessibility-focused, secure applications.

We believe that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of web application development. We prioritize accessibility in everything we do, from design to development to testing. We create accessibility-first web applications that are designed to meet the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

At 64 Robots, security is a critical aspect of web application development, and we take it seriously. We follow strict security protocols and employ a range of security testing techniques to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. We conduct a thorough risk assessment at the beginning of the development process to identify potential security risks and develop a plan to address them.

We pride ourselves on building partnerships with our clients and providing full transparency at each stage of every project lifecycle.
