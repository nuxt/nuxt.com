Today, weâ€™re releasing **Nuxt UI v4**, a major milestone that redefines our component library. With this release, we are unifying Nuxt UI and Nuxt UI Pro into a single, powerful, and completely free open-source library.

This marks an exciting new chapter for our ecosystem, made possible since [NuxtLabs joined Vercel](https://nuxtlabs.com). Our shared commitment to the open-source community has allowed us to make every component from the simplest button to the most advanced dashboard section accessible to everyone, at no cost.

What was previously a premium offering is now available to all. Over 100 components, advanced sections, and production-ready templates are now yours to build with, unified in one place.

## ðŸš€ Build anything, faster than ever

Nuxt UI v4 gives you the power to build modern, polished applications with the speed of a startup. You can now create the complex interfaces seen across the web, from beautiful landing pages with pricing tables to feature-rich SaaS dashboards, all without starting from scratch.

This is possible because Nuxt UI v4 unifies everything you need into a single, cohesive package:

- **100+ Components:** An extensive library to build anything from simple websites to complex applications.
- **7 Free Templates:** Start your next project in minutes with a production-ready template for a **Landing Page**, **SaaS**, **Dashboard**, **Docs site**, **Portfolio**, **Chat app**, or **Changelog**.
- **Rich Content & Typography:** Beautifully render Markdown and build content-rich sites with our advanced prose components, fully integrated with Nuxt Content.
- **Vue and Nuxt Compatibility:** Works in any Vue or Nuxt project.

The entire Pro suite is now yours. Build with powerful components previously exclusive to our paid users, now free for everyone.

::code-group

```vue [Landing Page]
<template>
  <UApp>
    <UHeader :links="navigation" />

    <UPageHero
      title="Your SaaS Platform"
      description="Everything you need to succeed"
    />

    <UPageSection title="Features">
      <UPageGrid>
        <UPageCard
          v-for="feature in features"
          :key="feature.id"
          :title="feature.title"
          :description="feature.description"
        />
      </UPageGrid>
    </UPageSection>

    <UPricingTable :plans="pricingPlans" />

    <UFooter />
  </UApp>
</template>
```

```vue [Documentation]

## ðŸŽ¨ From design to code, seamlessly

A successful project starts with a solid design system. In v4, we are releasing the **complete Figma Kit** for free, mirroring the entire component library.

With over **2,000 component variants and design tokens**, you now have a single Figma entry point that contains every component along with detailed explanations about structure and usage. Designers and developers work from the same comprehensive source, making collaboration seamless and ensuring a perfect match between design and implementation.

[Get the Figma Kit â†’](https://go.nuxt.com/figma-ui)

## âœ¨ An upgraded developer experience

Beyond new components, v4 brings significant improvements to your workflow.

### âš¡ Effortless migration

Unlike the major overhaul from v2 to v3, the migration to v4 is simple. This release focuses on unification, not breaking changes. Most components work identically, and your existing code will remain largely intact.

Check out our [migration guide](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/migration/v4) for a complete walkthrough.

### ðŸ“š A refined documentation

We've completely overhauled our documentation to make it clearer and more intuitive. Weâ€™ve restructured the layout and split complex topics into dedicated pages, ensuring you can find the information you need, faster.

It's also now powered by our new **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**. This allows AI tools like Cursor and future integrations to access component documentation and metadata directly, right inside your editor.

### ðŸ¤– Ready for the next wave of AI

Our AI chat components now support **Vercel's AI SDK v5**. The new `Chat` class and message format (with `parts`) ensure compatibility with the latest AI SDK improvements, keeping you at the forefront of AI development.

## ðŸ’š A thank you to our pro users

We want to extend a special thanks to everyone who supported Nuxt UI Pro. Your early adoption and feedback were instrumental in shaping Nuxt UI. You helped us fund, maintain, and improve the project, allowing us to reach this milestone where we can now offer these powerful tools to the entire community.

Your support made this moment possible.

## The future is open

Nuxt UI v4 is just the beginning. With a unified codebase and the backing of Vercel, we're more excited than ever to push the boundaries of component development. This release wouldn't have been possible without the support of our amazing community, and every contributor who has helped shape Nuxt UI.

We can't wait to see what you build. The future of UI development is free, open, and more powerful than ever.
