Nuxt 4.3 brings powerful new features for layouts, caching, and developer experience &ndash; plus significant performance improvements under the hood.

## 🗂️ Route Rule Layouts

You can now set layouts directly in route rules using the new `appLayout` property ([#31092](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/31092)). This provides a centralized, declarative way to manage layouts across your application without scattering `definePageMeta` calls throughout your pages.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/admin/**': { appLayout: 'admin' },
    '/dashboard/**': { appLayout: 'dashboard' },
    '/auth/**': { appLayout: 'minimal' }
  }
})
```

This is particularly useful for:
- Admin panels with a shared layout across many routes
- Marketing pages that need a different layout from the app
- Auth flows with a minimal, distraction-free layout

::tip
You can also pass props to layouts now! See [the `setPageLayout` improvements below](#layout-props-with-setpagelayout).

## 📦 ISR/SWR Payload Extraction

Payload extraction now works with ISR (incremental static regeneration), SWR (stale-while-revalidate) and cache `routeRules` ([#33467](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33467)). Previously, only pre-rendered pages could generate `_payload.json` files.

This means:
- Client-side navigation to ISR/SWR pages can use cached payloads
- CDNs (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare) can cache payload files alongside HTML
- Fewer API calls during navigation &ndash; data can be prefetched and served from the cached payload

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  routeRules: {
    '/products/**': { 
      isr: 3600, // Revalidate every hour
    }
  }
})
```

## 🧹 Dev Mode Payload Extraction

Related to the above, payload extraction now also works in development mode ([#30784](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/30784)). This makes it easier to test and debug payload behavior without needing to run a production build.

::important
Payload extraction works in dev mode with `nitro.static` set to `true`, or for individual pages which have `isr`, `swr`, `prerender` or `cache` route rules.

## 🚫 Disable Modules from Layers

When extending Nuxt layers, you can now disable specific modules that you don't need ([#33883](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33883)). Just pass `false` to the module's options:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: ['../shared-layer'],
  // disable @nuxt/image from layer
  image: false,
})
```

## 🏷️ Route Groups in Page Meta

[Route groups](/docs/4.x/directory-structure/app/pages#route-groups) (folders wrapped in parentheses like `(protected)/`) are now exposed in page meta ([#33460](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33460)). This makes it easy to check which groups a route belongs to in middleware or anywhere you have access to the route.

```vue [pages/(protected)/dashboard.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
// This page's meta will include: { groups: ['protected'] }
useRoute().meta.groups
</script>
```

```ts [middleware/auth.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  if (to.meta.groups?.includes('protected') && !isAuthenticated()) {
    return navigateTo('/login')
  }
})
```

This provides a clean, convention-based approach to route-level authorization without needing to add `definePageMeta` to every protected page.

## 🎨 Layout Props with `setPageLayout`

The `setPageLayout` composable now accepts a second parameter to pass props to your layout ([#33805](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33805)):

```ts [middleware/admin.ts]
export default defineNuxtRouteMiddleware((to) => {
  setPageLayout('admin', {
    sidebar: true,
    theme: 'dark'
  })
})
```

```vue [layouts/admin.vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{
  sidebar?: boolean
  theme?: 'light' | 'dark'
}>()
</script>
```

## 🔧 `#server` Alias

A new `#server` alias provides clean imports within your server directory ([#33870](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33870)), similar to how `#shared` works:

```ts [server/api/users/[id]/profile.ts]
// Before: relative path hell
import { helper } from '../../../../utils/helper'

// After: clean and predictable
import { helper } from '#server/utils/helper'
```

The alias includes import protection &ndash; you can't accidentally import `#server` code from client or shared contexts.

## 🪟 Draggable Error Overlay

The development error overlay introduced in Nuxt 4.2 is now draggable and can be minimized ([#33695](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33695)). You can:

- Drag it to any corner of the screen (it snaps to edges)
- Minimize it to a small pill button when you want to keep working
- Your position and minimized state persist across page reloads

This is a quality-of-life improvement when you're iterating on fixes and don't want the overlay blocking your view.

## ⚙️ Async Plugin Constructors

Module authors can now use async functions when adding build plugins ([#33619](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33619)):

```ts [modules/my-module.ts]
export default defineNuxtModule({
  async setup() {
    // Lazy load only when actually needed
    addVitePlugin(() => import('my-cool-plugin').then(r => r.default()))
    
    // No need to load webpack plugin if using Vite
    addWebpackPlugin(() => import('my-cool-plugin/webpack').then(r => r.default()))
  }
})
```

This enables true lazy loading of build plugins, avoiding unnecessary code loading when plugins aren't needed.

## 🚀 Performance Improvements

This release includes several performance optimizations for faster builds:

- **Hook filters** - Internal plugins now use filters to avoid running hooks unnecessarily ([#33898](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33898))
- **SSR styles optimization** - The `nuxt:ssr-styles` plugin is now significantly faster ([#33862](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33862), [#33865](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33865))
- **Layer alias transform** - Skipped when using Vite (it handles this natively) ([#33864](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33864))
- **Route rules compilation** - Route rules are now compiled into a client chunk using `rou3`, removing the need for `radix3` in the client bundle and eliminating app manifest fetches ([#33920](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33920))

## 🎨 Inline Styles for Webpack/Rspack

The `inlineStyles` feature now works with webpack and rspack builders ([#33966](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33966)), not just Vite. This enables critical CSS inlining for better Core Web Vitals regardless of your bundler choice.

## ⚠️ Deprecations

### `statusCode` → `status`, `statusMessage` → `statusText`

In preparation for Nitro v3 and H3 v2, we're moving to use Web API naming conventions ([#33912](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33912)). The old properties still work but are deprecated in advance of v5:

```diff
- throw createError({ statusCode: 404, statusMessage: 'Not Found' })
+ throw createError({ status: 404, statusText: 'Not Found' })
```

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

Notable fixes in this release:

- Fixed head component deduplication using `key` attribute ([#33958](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33958), [#33963](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33963))
- Fixed async data properties not being reactive in Options API ([#34119](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34119))
- Fixed `useCookie` unsafe number parsing during decode ([#34007](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34007))
- Fixed `NuxtPage` not re-rendering when nested `NuxtLayout` has layouts disabled ([#34078](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34078))
- Fixed client-side pathname decoding for non-ASCII route aliases ([#34043](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34043))
- Fixed suspense remounting when navigating after pending state ([#33991](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33991))
- Fixed clipboard copy in error overlay ([#33873](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33873))
- Enabled `allowArbitraryExtensions` by default in TypeScript config ([#34084](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/34084))
- Added `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` to server tsconfig for safer typing ([#33985](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/pull/33985))

::important
Enabling `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` in the Nitro server TypeScript config improves type safety but may surface new type errors in your server code. This change was necessary because Nuxt's app context performs type checks on server routes ([learn more](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/guide/modules/recipes-advanced#known-limitations)). 

While we recommend keeping this enabled for better type safety, you can disable it if needed:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    typescript: {
      tsConfig: {
        compilerOptions: {
          noUncheckedIndexedAccess: false
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Note that disabling this may allow type errors to slip through that could cause runtime issues with indexed access.

## ✅ Upgrading

Our recommendation for upgrading is to run:

```sh
npx nuxt upgrade --dedupe
```

This will deduplicate your lockfile and help ensure you pull in updates from other dependencies that Nuxt relies on, particularly in the unjs ecosystem.
