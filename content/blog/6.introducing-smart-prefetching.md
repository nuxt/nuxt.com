## Introducing Smart prefetching ⚡️

Starting from [Nuxt v2.4.0](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/releases/tag/v2.4.0), Nuxt will automagically prefetch the code-splitted pages linked with `<nuxt-link>` when visible in the viewport **by default**. This hugely improves the end user performances, inspired by [quicklink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/quicklink).

Demos are online and we recommend you to try it out to feel the difference:

- No prefetching (v2.3): [https://nuxt-no-prefetch.surge.sh](https://nuxt-no-prefetch.surge.sh)
- With prefetching (v2.4): [https://nuxt-prefetch.surge.sh](https://nuxt-prefetch.surge.sh)

You can learn more about this feature in the [`<nuxt-link>`](https://v2.nuxt.com/docs/features/nuxt-components#the-nuxtlink-component) section of the documentation.
