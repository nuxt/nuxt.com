Our Story
#block1
[Alexandre Chopin]{.text-blue-400} and [Sébastien Chopin]{.text-green-400} discovered their passion for computers and web development deep within the Pyrenees Mountains (heritage reflected in the NuxtLabs logo if you haven’t noticed!). They taught themselves how to code as kids and designed websites at night, weekends and during school holidays.
<br><br>
They worked on their first external project together, creating a browser game website built with PHP, HTML, CSS and jQuery - this fortunately covered part of their college studies! They both had the entrepreneurial bug at this point.
#block2
Nuxt is born in 2017 few months after the production release of NuxtJS and the need of many companies for Nuxt training and consultancy such as Adobe, Accor, BackMarket, Bershka, Lequipe, Sephora, Ubisoft and many others.
<br><br>
In January 2020, NuxtLabs raised $2M (pre-seed) to build a team of Nuxt experts working full time on Open Source and business solutions around it.
