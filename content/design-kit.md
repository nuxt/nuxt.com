## Logo History

The Nuxt logo has evolved gradually over time, but the mountain shape and wordmark have been constant elements in its design.

![Nuxt Logo Timeline](/assets/design-kit/timeline-dark.svg){class="hidden dark:block w-full"}

## Nuxt Logo

The logo is made from two elements: the triangular mountains and the wordmark. In most cases, they should appear together as the opposite master lockup shows. The triangular mountains can be used on their own as an icon, profile picture or badge, but the wordmark should never be used without this symbol on the side.

## Color Palette

## DM Sans

Our brand typeface is DM Sans from Google Fonts. This typeface was chosen for its aesthetics, reminiscent of the shape of the Nuxt logo in many aspects (joints, apex, vertex of the structure). It offers modernity and sobriety while lending an iconic aspect to our visual content without compromising text accessibility.

Font is also variable which allows us to fit with any contexts.

[DM Sans]{class="font-semibold text-5xl text-gray-900 dark:text-white"}

[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.]{class="font-semibold text-4xl text-gray-900 dark:text-white"}

### Usage

For Nuxt brand, we will only use Regular / Medium / Semibold weights 99% of the time. You should avoid Light & Heavy if you want to use it as Nuxt Identity. Only exceptions are for super, subscript characters, also you can use heavy if you go upper than 72px for a font size.
Figma only includes a limited number of DM Sans variants by default. To access all the available variables of DM Sans, you can download them here (remember to restart Figma after installing the font on your computer).
