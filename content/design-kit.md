## Logo History

The Nuxt logo has evolved gradually over time, but the mountain shape and wordmark have been constant elements in its design.

## Nuxt Logo

The logo is made from two elements: the triangular mountains and the wordmark. In most cases, they should appear together as the opposite master lockup shows. The triangular mountains can be used on their own as an icon, profile picture or badge, but the wordmark should never be used without this symbol on the side.
