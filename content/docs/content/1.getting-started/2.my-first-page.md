# Writing my first page

Let's walk through the creation of a simple introduction page.

## Create the file

With @nuxt/content, a page is a Markdown file inside content directory.

``` [Directory structure]
content/
  1.index.md
```

## Write Front-matter

Specifying [Front-matter](/writing/front-matter) data lets you configure your page data.

```markdown [index.md]
---
navigation: false // We want to hide this page from navigation
layout: // Hide aside on large screens, preserve it for mobile
  asideClass: 'block lg:hidden'
  aside: true
  footer: false
---
```

## Use your components

Using our custom syntax, you can easily add and configure components into your pages.

```markdown [index.md]
... Front-matter 👆

::block-hero
---
cta:
  - Get started
