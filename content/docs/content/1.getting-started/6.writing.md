# Writing content

Create a `content/` directory in your project and create some contents:

```
content/
  getting-started/
    index.md
    installation.md
    writing.md
  index.md
```

This module will list files inside `content` directory and parse them. It supports `.md` and `.yaml` extension.

## Ordering

Add numeric prefix to files and directories inside `content` directory to give them in order.
This module will use this numbers to order contents list.

> Separate number form file name using `.` character. Usinf any other separator will does not work in ordering system.

```
content/
  1.frameworks/
    1.vue.md
    2.nuxt.md 
  2.examples/
    1.vercel.md
    2.netlify.md
    3.heroku.md
    index.md
```

## Ignoring

Content module will ignore dot files and folders from listing in contents list.
Adding `.` prefix to any file will make them to be ignored.

> Note: When a directory name starts with `.` all of its nested contents will be ignored.

```
content/
   1.frameworks/
    .1.vue.md              // Ignored content
    2.nuxt.md 
  .2.translation/          // Ignored directory
    1.fa/
      1.messages.md        // Ignored content because of its grand parent
    2.fr/
      1.messages.md        // Ignored content because of its grand parent
```

## Partials

Adding `_` prefix to files will mark them as partial contents.
Partial contents are accessible in search and contents list but they we be invisible in content navigation.

> Note: When a directory name starts with `_` all of its nested contents will mark as partial.

```
content/
   1.frameworks/
    _1.vue.md              // Partial content
    2.nuxt.md 
  _2.translation/          // Partial directory
    1.fa/
      1.messages.md        // Partial content because of its grand parent
    2.fr/
      1.messages.md        // Partial content because of its grand parent
```
