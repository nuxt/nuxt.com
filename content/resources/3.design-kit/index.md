The Primaries
#description
Based on our iconic NuxtJS green, our primary colors represents the past the present and the future of the Nuxt brand. Adding more colors grant us more possibilities for emphasing content. We choose to go in direction of the blue because it reminds VueJS where it all started and fits
far better with Nuxt DNA than warm colors.

The Gradient
#description
This gradient is here to represent the brand, across all supports (landings, apps, socials medias, videos). It’s designed to represent evolution of NuxtJS to a bigger solution including more products. It also keeps a bit of contact with nature identity, evocating an aurora which provide a feeling of dream.

The Secondaries
#description
Our secondary palette contains a variety of colors with all the same base hue (the one of our iconic NuxtJS green) to keep consistency. We lean these colors more on the current & future Nuxt products to define their identity. By doing so, brand awareness & identity should be recognisable by every user.
