The Primaries
#description
Based on our iconic NuxtJS green, our primary colors represents the past the present and the future of the Nuxt brand. Adding more colors grant us more possibilities for emphasing content. We choose to go in direction of the blue because it reminds VueJS where it all started and fits
far better with Nuxt DNA than warm colors.

The Gradient
#description
This gradient is here to represent the brand, across all supports (landings, apps, socials medias, videos). It’s designed to represent evolution of NuxtJS to a bigger solution including more products. It also keeps a bit of contact with nature identity, evocating an aurora which provide a feeling of dream.

The Secondaries
#description
Our secondary palette contains a variety of colors with all the same base hue (the one of our iconic NuxtJS green) to keep consistency. We lean these colors more on the current & future Nuxt products to define their identity. By doing so, brand awareness & identity should be recognisable by every user.

Monograms
#description
Our logo honours the high mountains of the Pyrenees, the place where it all started. The shape is drawn with a smooth but structured path, that locks itself like an infinity symbol.<br />This is one of our most powerful tools to communicate our story and the values behind our brand.

Roobert font
#description
Our brand typeface is Roobert PRO by the Display Foundry. This typeface was chosen for it’s aesthetic reminding the shape of Nuxt logo by many aspects (joints, apex, vertex of the structure). It provides modernity and sobriety while giving an iconic aspect of our visual content and without decreasing the accessibility of texts.<br /><br />
Font is also variable which allows us to fit with any contexts.

Usage
#description
For Nuxt brand, we will only use Regular / Medium / Semibold / Bold weights 99% of the time. You should avoid Light & Heavy if you want to use it as Nuxt Identity. Only exceptions are for super, subscript characters, also you can use heavy if you go upper than 72px for a font size.
As Roobert font is licensed, you cannot use it for free so you can use the [Inter font]{ .underline .font-semibold } as an alternative. If you want to have visuals with Roobert official font, contact us we will give you the asset ready.
