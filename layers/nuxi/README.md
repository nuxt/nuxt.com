# Nuxi layer

Everything for the Nuxi assistant on nuxt.com lives here.

```
layers/nuxi/
├── agent/          # Eve runtime (channels, tools, hooks) — deployed as the `eve` Vercel service
├── app/            # Chat UI (panel, dashboard, composables)
├── server/         # Nuxt APIs + internal routes the agent calls over HTTP
└── shared/         # Types and utils shared by app + server
```

## Boundaries

| Layer | Runs in | Talks to |
|-------|---------|----------|
| `agent/` | Eve (`eve dev` / Vercel `eve` service) | Nuxt via `/api/internal/*` (`INTERNAL_API_SECRET`) |
| `server/api/internal/*` | Nuxt Nitro | DB, GitHub, content — never exposed publicly |
| `server/api/chats/*`, `agent/*` | Nuxt Nitro | Browser (session auth) |
| `app/` | Browser | Nuxt APIs + Eve transport (`/_eve_internal/eve`) |

The agent never imports Nuxt server code directly. Shared logic that both sides need either lives in `shared/` (app + server) or is exposed through an internal API route.

## Config

`eve.eveRoot` points Eve at this layer so `agent/` is discovered at `layers/nuxi/agent/`. The layer includes a minimal `package.json` (Eve project marker for nested layout discovery). Root `vercel.json` declares the dual `web` + `eve` services with `entrypoint: "layers/nuxi"` for Eve.
